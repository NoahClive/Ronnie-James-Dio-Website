    <p1>Ronald James Padavona, better known as Ronnie James Dio, was one of the most influential figures in heavy metal
        music and is regarded as one of the greatest heavy metal musicians of all time. His multiple decades of
        popularity paved the way for many metal bands and helped define the genre into what it is today. Ronnie was
        connected to many of the most prominent metal bands and musicians of the time such as Black Sabbath, Rainbow,
        and his own band, Dio. Although he passed away in 2010, his influence still carries on in his iconic music and
