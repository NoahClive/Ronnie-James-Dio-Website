    <div class="bio-title">Ronnie James Dio, the Metal God with Devil Horns</div>
    <div class="bio-text">

        <p>Ronald James Padavona, better known as Ronnie James Dio, was one of the most influential figures in heavy
            metal music and is regarded as one of the greatest heavy metal musicians of all time. His multiple
            decades
            of popularity paved the way for many metal bands and helped define the genre into what it is today.
            Ronnie
            was connected to many of the most prominent metal bands and musicians of the time such as Black Sabbath,
            Rainbow, and his own band, Dio. Although he passed away in 2010, his influence still carries on in his
            iconic music and effect on the metal industry.
        </p>
        <p>Ronald James Padavona was born on July 10, 1942 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. He had an average childhood
            growing up with his Italian American family in Cortland, New York. His interest in music began at a young
            age, playing bass and trumpet for his local high school band, The Vegas Kings (Prato, “Ronnie James Dio |
            Biography & History”). The band would be renamed to Ronnie and the Red Caps releasing a single album in 1958
            titled <i>Lover</i>. Ronald would change his stage name to Ronnie James Dio in 1961. “Dio”, meaning “God” in
            Italian, was a reference to the Italian gangster Giovanni Ignazio Dioguardi, who went by the name Johnny Dio
            (Hartmann). In a 2000 interview with the St. Petersburg Times, Dio goes into detail about how he got his
            iconic stage name:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">Well, literally it means God, which I had no idea when I chose it. I took it from a famous
            Floridian, a man named Johnny Dio who was a…a pretty well known…I guess you’d have to say a mafia man… I’m
            trying to be gentle with this. He wasn’t one of my heroes or anything but I am proud to be of Italian
            extraction, and I didn’t want to lose that in my stage name. I was reading something at the time about
            “underground figures” and the Italian name “Dio” popped out at me, and it seemed very concise. And maybe if
            I need any “help” I could give somebody a call… No. I just loved the name. And the number of coincidences
            that have followed, and when I was in Black Sabbath people really started playing with it as a word game,
            and and then other people assumed that I thought I was God or something, which of course I don’t. (Welch)
        </p>
        <p>Just like Dio, the band would also change names one more time in 1961, becoming Ronnie Dio and the Prophets.
            During this time he briefly studied pharmacy at the University of Buffalo in New York but quickly realising
            that music was his true passion, he chose not to graduate. The band made several songs and an album before
            eventually disbanding in 1967. Alongside guitarist Nick Pantas, Dio formed a new band titled the Electric
            Elves. Much like the previous band, this one would quickly acquire a new name simply titled, Elf in 1969
            (Sweeting). The band would get a gig opening for Deep Purple. Impressed by Dio’s vocal talent and after
            recently leaving Deep Purple, ex-guitarist Ritchie Blackmore invited most of the members of Elf to join his
            new group, Rainbow (Prato, “Ronnie James Dio | Biography & History”).
        </p>
        <p>Dio joined Rainbow in 1975 as its lead singer and would write many of the band’s songs alongside Ritchie
            Blackmore. The band released its first album titled, <i>Ritchie Blackmore’s Rainbow</i>, on August 4, 1975.
            The
            album quickly gained popularity peaking at number thirty on the Billboard Top 100 on October 25, 1975
            (“Chart History Rainbow”). Dio chose to write more about medieval themes in his music and used his
            incredible vocal range to sing both hard rock and less intense rock ballads. Soon after the release of the
            album, Blackmore fired everyone from the band except Dio due to disagreements with the styles that the band
            members played in. The band recruited new members and began touring in the US in late 1975. The band rapidly
            established itself as a popular live act introducing Dio to large live performances. The band would release
            a second album in 1976 titled, <i>Rising</i>, and a third in 1978 titled, <i>Long Live Rock ‘n’ Roll</i>
            (“Ritchie
            Blackmore’s Rainbow History with Final Vocalist Doogie White”). After the release of these albums and a long
            world tour between 1977 and 1978, Blackmore wanted to take the band in a new direction away from the themes
            of
            “sword and sorcery”. Examining the success of <i>Long Live Rock ‘n’ Roll</i>, he was thinking of altering
            the
            band’s sound to be more like mainstream hard rock. Because of their creative differences and the feeling
            that Dio was living in the shadow of guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, Dio finally decided to leave the band in
            1979 (Rivadavia, “Rainbow | Biography & History”). In total, Dio wrote fifteen songs alongside Blackmore
            during his stay with Rainbow.
        </p>
        <p> Following his departure from Rainbow, Dio joined Black Sabbath in 1979 replacing Ozzy Osbourne as the lead
            vocalist. The band’s first album written with Dio, <i>Heaven and Hell</i>, was incredibly successful
            becoming Black
            Sabbath’s third best selling LP (Monger, “Black Sabbath | Biography & History”). During his stint with Black
            Sabbath, Dio pioneered an integral part of metal culture, the devil horns. On the subject he was quoted
            saying, “Ozzy used the peace sign, so I wanted something different. I remember my grandmother used this sign
            to ward off evil; I thought it would work in the context of Sabbath. But I had no idea it would catch on”
            (Dome). Dio’s powerful voice proved to be a good replacement for the band’s frontman and helped bring the
            band out of its creative slump that it had been in for so long. The band’s tenth studio album, <i>Mob
                Rules</i>,
            released on November 4, 1981 to somewhat mixed reviews but still went gold in the United States (“Gold &
            Platinum”). The single track “The Mob Rules” was featured in the cult 1981 animated film, Heavy Metal.
            <i>Live
                Evil</i> was the band's first live album and also the last album that Dio would collaborate on for some
            time.
            Released in 1982, it received mild success but internal struggles would eventually tear apart the band. One
            questionable theory on why Dio left Black Sabbath was that he was accused by members Tony Lommi and Geezer
            Butler of sneaking into the recording studio to turn up the volume on his lyrics (Rivadavia, “How Black
            Sabbath’s ‘Live Evil’ Marked the End of First Dio Era”). A more realistic take was that tensions within the
            band members combined with Dio looking to prove himself as not just a “singer for hire” led to the eventual
            separation of the band. This would culminate into the formation of his own band simply named Dio in 1982,
            leaving no interpretation as to who was in charge (Prato, “Ronnie James Dio | Biography & History”).
        </p>
        <p>Initially formed with ex-Black Sabbath drummer Vinny Appice, bassist Jimmy Bain, guitarist Vivian Campbell,
            and Ronnie James Dio, Dio very rapidly became a massive success. Dio’s first solo album <i>Holy Diver</i>,
            released
            in 1983, is regarded as one of the greatest heavy metal albums of the 1980s and still is one of the greatest
            metal albums today. The band would quickly garner success with their over the top live shows featuring
            extravagant pyrotechnics and powerful performances. Dio released a second album in 1984 titled <i>The Last
                in
                Line</i> which became the band’s biggest hit and earned platinum sales alongside <i>Holy Diver</i>
            (“Gold & Platinum”).
            In 1985, Dio would headline a heavy metal version of the Band Aid/USA for Africa known as Hear ‘n Aid with
            all the generated funds being sent to fight hunger in Africa (Prato, “Ronnie James Dio | Biography &
            History”). The same year, Dio would release its third studio album titled, <i>Sacred Heart</i>. The album
            received
            good sales numbers but would be a far cry from Dio’s finest work. Unfortunately, Dio would never again live
            up to the same success as <i>Holy Diver</i> or <i>The Last in Line</i>. In 1986, the band released a live EP
            titled,
            <i>Intermission</i>, and a studio album in 1987 titled, <i>Dream Evil</i>. By the 1990s, Ronnie was the only
            original
            member of Dio left leading to an unstable lineup throughout the 90s (Prato, “Dio | Biography & History”).
            Dio briefly reunited with Black Sabbath leading to 1992’s <i>Dehumanizer</i> album and a short tour. The
            reunion
            didn’t last long as Dio would return to his solo work producing the albums <i>Angry Machines</i> in 1996,
            <i>Magica</i> in
            2000, and <i>Killing the Dragon</i> in 2002.
        </p>
        <p>In 2006, Dio joined his former Black Sabbath bandmates Tony Lommi, Geezer Butler, and Vinny Appice in a
            collaboration band named Heaven & Hell. The band was named after the title of the first Black Sabbath album
            featuring Dio and toured from 2007 to 2009. Unfortunately, Dio was diagnosed with stomach cancer and the
            band cancelled their summer 2010 tour plans. Although there was hope that he would make a recovery, Ronnie
            James Dio passed away on May 16, 2010 in Houston, Texas (Monger, “Heaven & Hell | Biography & History”).
        </p>
        <p>In his passing, Dio left a long legacy and a large impression on the metal industry. Because of this, he is
            regarded as one of the most influential figures in heavy metal music and is considered one of the greatest
            heavy metal musicians of all time. Being connected to many of the most prominent metal bands and musicians
            of the time such as Black Sabbath, Rainbow, and his own band Dio, he paved the way for future metal
            musicians and helped shape the genre and culture into what it is today.
